![](https://github.com/najirh/netflix_sql_project/blob/main/logo.png)


## Overview
This data analysis project involves a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's movies and TV shows data using SQL. My goal was to extract valuable insights and answer various business questions based on the dataset. The following README provides a detailed account of the project's objectives, business problems, solutions, findings, and conclusions. Below are 15 business insights that I was able to extract via SQL.

## Objectives

- Analyze the distribution of content types (movies vs TV shows).
- Identify the most common ratings for movies and TV shows.
- List and analyze content based on release years, countries, and durations.
- Explore and categorize content based on specific criteria and keywords.

## Dataset

The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:
